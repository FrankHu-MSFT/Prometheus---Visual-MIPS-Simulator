# Prometheus - Visual MIPS Simulator
 This is was my Senior Project at the University of Georgia, where I fleshed out a concept with a software design specification for a visual MIPS simulator utilizing JavaFX 

# Docs
Please see the JavaDocs in the doc folder for info on the code. 
These JavaDocs were generated using Eclipse per : https://www.codejava.net/ides/eclipse/how-to-generate-javadoc-in-eclipse
To read them, you can download the Git Repo and open the index.html file. 

Please see the Software Specifications Document Folder for more information on this project.
It describes every scenario, class structure, and some basic pictures of what the Visual MIPS Simulator should have.

# Support
This is not a supported repository, and I have no thoughts on further pursuing this project. Although I hope that someday someone is able to flesh out the rest of this project to have an animated visual MIPS Simulator.
