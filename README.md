# Prometheus - Visual MIPS Simulator
 This is was my Senior Project at the University of Georgia, where I fleshed out a concept with a software design specification for a visual MIPS simulator utilizing JavaFX 

# Docs
Please see the JavaDocs in the doc folder for info on the code.
Please see the FrankHuDirectedStudyWriteup Doc for more information on the project.

# Support
This is not a supported repository, and I have no thoughts on further pursuing this project. Although I hope that someday someone is able to flesh out the rest of this project to have an animated visual MIPS Simulator.
